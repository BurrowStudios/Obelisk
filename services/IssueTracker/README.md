# Bruno

Bruno bypasses the need for an external issue tracker system (ITS) for teams that communicate via Discord by
complementing the existing structure of forum channels in a way that makes them easier to use as an ITS.

This mainly includes prioritizing and assignment of issues via automated tagging. While Discord forum channels were not
meant to be used as an ITS, Bruno strives to fill in the gaps to make it possible.
