# Obelisk

Obelisk is the monolithic backend for the Burrow Studios API.

### Scopes

Since the originally planned architecture (microservice-based) has been temporarily abandoned to minimize initial
development time and effort, this project encompasses nearly all scopes of the planned services.

- RESTful API
- Socket-based event manager
- Authentication & Authorization
- User & permission management
- Issue Tracker infrastructure
- Synchronized cross-platform chat

### ⚠️ Early development notice ⚠️

Please note that this application is still in early development and not officially supported until the first release.
