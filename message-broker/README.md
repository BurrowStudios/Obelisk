# Obelisk Message Broker

The Obelisk backend uses [RabbitMQ](https://github.com/docker-library/rabbitmq/) as a message broker, simplifying
communications between layers and services.

### ⚠️ Untested
This setup guide is currently untested and probably wrong. For now, it's more of a placeholder.

## Setup

#### Prerequisites

- Docker Compose

#### Installation

The setup can be initiated by downloading the script and executing it:

```bash
curl -s https://github.com/BurrowStudios/Obelisk/message-broker/message-broker-setup.sh | bash
```
